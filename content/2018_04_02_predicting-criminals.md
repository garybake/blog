Slug: predicting-criminals

Using machine learning estimate whether someone is going to commit a crime in the future.

My annotated entry is [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/garybake/kaggle_entries/blob/4f061f43d4aea2810610d492602ad403ca32c98a/CrimPredict.ipynb) or to play with it and run the code in google colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/garybake/kaggle_entries/blob/master/CrimPredict.ipynb)

####Update

I haven't updated the site in a while but I have been busy. At some point I will get round to adding the following

 - Kaggle predictions for car insurance
 - A partial gameboy emulator
 - Reinforcement learning (on a much better working GB emulator)
 - Some other fun things from playing with Keras
 - Turning the lights on with google assistant and a 433mhz transmitter
 - Where is dad picture frame
 - IoT doorbell

Anyways I've updated the site today to include an entry in a machine learning competition.
