## Applying Software Engineering Principles to Everyday Challenges

Its that time of year and again I've made a resolution to post once a month. We'll see how far I get.  

I was looking around for posts and came accross the old trello board we used when buying a house. How it made the whole process less daunting. Using an agile board to manage projects is something I use every day as a developer. I'm sure there's other ideas I use as a developer that I use in my normal life to make it easier. I'll make a list and share it with the world.

Note that I have chatgpt alongside as a copilot. Not to write the article, more to bounce ideas off. I use it everyday for programming and would like to think my productivity and output quality has improved.
