I see a lot of top 10 book lists and many seem a bit spammy and a bit samey.
Here I want to show a list of books that mean a lot to me and helped me in my career. Not just books on how to do data science but things that are interesting if you are in the field.

## 1. Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow  
[![Hands-on Machine Learning]({static}/images/books/01_HandsOnMachineLearning.jpg)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646)   
Aurelien Geron  
ISBN: 978-1492032649  

Hands down my favourite book so naturally goes first. It's my go to bible for any machine learning concepts. My old copy was well thumbed and thankfully a second edition means I have a neater copy on my shelf. This book has everything you need to start in machine learning, all of the core algorithms and metrics, all explained in a really clear way. 

I haven't used the second half - the deep learning half - of the book as much, I had another amazing book for that.

## 2. Deep Learning with Python

François Chollet  
ISBN: 978-1617296864  


My second favourite DS book. Also recently updated to a second edition so I have a fresh copy. (Congratulations to the people on facebook who received my donated first editions). 

This is the book that helped me to learn about deep learning and all the fun of neural networks. The book is based on Keras and written by the author of Keras. It's a really dense book but again everything is explained in an easily digestible way. Along with requests and fastapi, keras has a special place in my list of favourite libraries. It's so clear and easy to use. 

I'm just a little sad that I'm moving over to pytorch and haven't found a book that matches Chollets readability.

## 3. Spark – The Definitive Guide
